###Predictable Accelerator Design with Time-Sensitive Affine Types
- Why Fuse generates C/C++ codes since it's designed for Verilog?  
- If "traditional HLS tools...allow uneven banking and silently insert additional hardware to account for the complicated access patterns that it induces". Why this time we won't have any complicated access pattern?
- A[1] is equivalent to A{1}[0]. How about A[3] given decl A:float[10 bank 2]?
- A question I remember asked by Chris was even though Fuse can constrain the syntax to be "safe", in real world, it would still be contrained by FPGA resources. The objective of designing Fuse, according to my understanding, is for 
- Highligted blocks? suffix or prefix?
